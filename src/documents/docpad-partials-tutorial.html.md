Partials are documents which can be inserted into other documents, and are also passed by the docpad rendering engine.

This tutorial assumes that you have a working DocPad installation already.



As an employee (some would call it volunteer) of a startup ([Simple Lifeforms](http://www.simplelifeforms.com)) you have to be a jack of all trades given the lack of resources you are working with. Because of this I have been doing more and more coding, even though I don't consider myself a programmer, and I have been pleasantly surprised with the developments in JavaScript since I last used it. Like a lot of us I am really excited about NodeJS and when my site needed redeveloping I decided to look into the options for NodeJS CMSes and found DocPad and it's creator Benjamin Lupton. I mention Benjamin because it seems to me that the early success of open-source projects is always driven by a zealot for the tech, and he is definitely that. I just hope he can find the right open source business model to make a [viable career out of his creation] [1]
