A studio mix I did a while ago showcasing various Funk / Jazz / Afrobeat styles from 70s Africa. 

Itâ€™s called Channeling Fela because for so many people he is the only afrobeat artist they know, and if we can channel the vibe people get from him then we can find out some amazing music and maybe see Africa as a place of art and culture and not famine and war.
